# marvel-star

This repository represents the group project by the Marvelous Data Miners team (@pnisenson ; @aditirai3 ; @eaogidan-2020 ; @pambaza). Using Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, API calls, and other tools, the group has ventured to determine which Marvel Comic character should be the next featured character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). 

The repo contains the following files/directories:
1.  Working File Directories for group members. Each of these directories has different files representing non-finished working files. This includes code, output and input files and other "test" files that were used in developing the final product.
2. Project Outline.docx - project outline presented at the beginning of the project our objectives and how we planned to achieve them. Due to the nature of the project, the finished product may represent altered or different objectives in some circumstances.
3. "Data Exploration...".ipynb - Jupyter notebook containing data cleaning and exploration of MCU API, Marvel Developer (Comics) API, and U.S. Census Data to be used in final analysis.
4. "Final Data Analysis...".ipynb - Jupyter notebook containing visualizations and analysis of data explored to conclude on our hypothesis and questions asked.
5. Project One PPT.pptx - PowerPoint presentation summarizing our project findings
6. Analysis.docx - Word document summarizing our project findings
7. uszips_new.csv - Input file used in Data Exploration to apply latitude and longitude to U.S. Census zip codes (courtesy of simplemaps.com)
8. marvel_files directory - All output files from the Jupyter notebooks including csv files (DataFrames) and png files (plot images)
9. .gitignore file - used to ignore upload of .py files on which we stored API keys for Marvel Developer, U.S. Census, and GMaps APIs
